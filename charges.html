  <h2 id="what-were-your-charges-">What were your charges?</h2>
<p>One count of fraud by accessing a protected computer and exceeds authorized access, one count of wire fraud, one count of extortion, one count of interstate threats, and one count of illicit digital transmission.</p>
<p>It is important to note I was never indicted by a grand jury, only charged by complaint. A jury would have had a difficult time getting the extortion and interstate threats charge to stick.</p>
<p>I ultimately pleaded guilty to the unauthorized computer access charge.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-unauthorized-computer-access-charge-">Why the unauthorized computer access charge?</h2>
<p>The content I was providing on my website was retrieved with cURL commands using <code>-H &#39;Cookies: #{cookies}&#39;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-wire-fraud-charge-">Why the wire fraud charge?</h2>
<p>Any fraud committed over a government-owned wire is wire fraud. I used the internet.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-extortion-">Why the extortion?</h2>
<p>I reported a series of important bugs to Major League Baseball around the time that an investigation opened into my website after I ran my mouth about the sports leagues in a popular online news outlet. Anyway, they dangled a carrot in front of me and asked how much I valued the bugs at and how I&#39;d get there, so I linked to Shopify&#39;s bug bounty calculator. </p>
<p>Bam, you just tried to extort Major League Baseball for $150,000, and we&#39;re going to run with this.</p>
<h3 id="wait-what-were-the-bugs-">Wait, what were the bugs?</h3>
<p>I won&#39;t say. There were eight of them and they could not have been more unrelated to streaming. Any other organization would have done backflips over server racks.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-interstate-threats-">Why the interstate threats?</h2>
<p>When I originally found the bugs I went to a known baseball journalist and suggested I had some really important information on how baseball is treating its fans and their security.</p>
<p>After they patched the bugs, I wanted to publish my findingsâ€”you know, for internet points. They got word that I had talked to this journalist and threw a fit.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-illicit-digital-transmission-">Why the illicit digital transmission?</h2>
<p>I definitely did this.</p>
<h2 id="what-were-you-looking-at-for-time-">What were you looking at for time?</h2>
<p>News said a lot of years but of course you plead guilty to lesser charges.</p>
<p>Going into sentencing I was looking at a little more than seven years. I got 36 months. My sentencing guidelines were so high because of the loss amount.</p>
<h3 id="did-you-really-make-3-million-dollars-">Did you really make $3 million dollars?</h3>
<p>No. Major League Baseball assumed I had 11,000 customers because I wrote a guest post for a website that doesn&#39;t exist anymore talking about how I scaled someone&#39;s business to 11,000 customers.</p>
<h3 id="wait-how-much-did-you-make-">Wait, how much did you make?</h3>
<p>Less than that.</p>
<h2 id="who-represented-you-">Who represented you?</h2>
<p>Jeffery Einhorn and I would recommend him and Jeffrey Lichtman without a second thought.</p>
<h2 id="you-take-a-lot-of-pride-for-something-you-were-arrested-for-what-gives-">You take a lot of pride for something you were arrested for, what gives?</h2>
<p>I&#39;m really proud of what I made, yes. I come from a broken home, and the community was a home to me for six years, so I have solace there. It also taught me an endless amount about running a startup, achieving critical mass, and talking and listening to customers. If I were to do it over again, I would have probably made an effort to make money instead of just coast.</p>
