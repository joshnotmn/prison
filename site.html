    <h2 id="why-did-you-do-it-">Why did you do it?</h2>
<p>It started as a proof of concept. My beloved BallStreams---a website to watch NBA games---pulled the rug and NBA fans like myself were left SOL. I made a proof of concept, posted it on Reddit, and eventually I put a paywall on it to see if anyone would bite. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever reach product market fit. Oops, I did. While it was, indeed, a subscription website, the motivation for starting and maintaining the website weren&#39;t financial---I&#39;d argue it was the opposite, even before being charged by the US Government.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-name-">Why the name?</h2>
<p>It was meant to be a joke.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-did-you-make-">How much did you make?</h2>
<p>Less than the reported loss amount by MLB.</p>
<h3 id="no-really-how-much-money-did-you-actually-make-">No, really... How much money did you actually make?</h3>
<p>Less than the reported loss amount.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-customers-did-you-have-">How many customers did you have?</h2>
<p>More than 1, and that includes plenty of league employees, referees and umpires, a few team owners, and a handful of players, amongst the sea of us mere fans.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-people-worked-with-you-on-it-">How many people worked with you on it?</h2>
<p>I had someone make the four graphics on the homepage, and I paid $60 for a stinger for the Roku app. Also, on the subject of Roku, BrightScript is an awful programming language.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-it-work-">How did it work?</h2>
<p>A lot of engineering. For nerds: It was a Rails-based application with 227 models, backed by a 1.2TB database---hardly your average streaming website. It was a monolith with two microservices for authenticating into a third-party service. The API for the apps was built with Grape and sat atop the monolith. I developed Caffeinate to handle customer lifecycle emails, and later released it as an open source package where it remains the most popular package of its kind for Rails applications. Many of the patterns used in the application are discussed in my book Caboose on the Loose.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-apps-did-you-have-">How many apps did you have?</h2>
<p>Apple TV, Android, Android TV/Fire Stick, ChromeCast, fourth-generation game consoles and newer, Roku, smart TVs, smart fridges, Tesla, and the usual web platforms.</p>
<h2 id="were-you-employed-during-this-time-">Were you employed during this time?</h2>
<p>Shoutout to my colleagues watching me burn myself out at UseSixty, AdQuick, and AngelList. Most of my colleagues knew I had such a website.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-the-weirdest-part-of-operating-the-website-">What was the weirdest part of operating the website?</h2>
<p>Someone once asked for the manager and said that I didn&#39;t have the capacity to work with someone with mental illness. That was a wild, wild email.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-feel-about-the-state-of-streaming-sports-and-blackouts-these-days-">How do you feel about the state of streaming sports and blackouts these days?</h2>
<p>I am intentionally leaving this blank, as much as I can while not leaving this blank.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-currently-do-any-shit-or-plan-on-doing-any-shit-that-could-get-you-arrested-these-day-">Do you currently do any shit, or plan on doing any shit that could get you arrested these day?</h2>
<p>No. I have zero interest in ever going back to prison or doing anything that could put me there.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-talk-more-about-how-the-website-worked">Can you talk more about how the website worked</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-commits-did-you-make-to-the-site-">How many commits did you make to the site?</h2>
<p>6,891.</p>
<h2 id="any-other-cool-parts-">Any other cool parts?</h2>
<p>I eventually built out a CDN with 100GBPS throughput for fun using Ceph and Nginx.</p>
